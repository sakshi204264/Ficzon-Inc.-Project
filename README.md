# Ficzon-Inc.-Project
The project involves FicZon Inc., an IT solutions provider facing declining sales due to increased market competition. Sales effectiveness depends heavily on lead quality, currently determined manually. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict lead quality using sales data, improving decision-making and enhancing sales performance.
